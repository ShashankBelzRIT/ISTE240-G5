        Accessibility ensures that everyone, regardless of physical or mental ability, can engage with digital
        experiences.
        It focuses on providing equal access and usability for people with diverse needs, such as visual,
        auditory, motor, or cognitive differences. This is not just a legal requirement in many regions, but
        it’s a moral and design imperative that benefits all users.

        Print media’s rise in accessibility began with the introduction of braille newspapers, Which allowed the blind to read physical newspapers without them being read to them. 
        This raised empowerment amongst the blind community as they were allowed more autonomy and independence from a society that declared them dependent.

      When digital media was first created, its access was restricted to those who needed accessibility. Once the DOJ clarified that Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act declared websites as public accommodations. As a public accommodation, it is required to be accessible to all.

        With the rise of digital media, accessibility has become a crucial aspect of web design. 
        Various tools and techniques have been developed to enhance accessibility, such as screen readers, 
        keyboard navigation, alt text for images, and adjustable text sizes. These tools help ensure that 
        individuals with disabilities can access and interact with digital content effectively.

        As society has developed, the flow of media has increased, reaching so many different eyes. With society’s reliance on media, its accessibility becomes of utmost importance. To be able to access vital information regardless of your disability is a privilege that many aren’t afforded. From varying levels of blindness, hearing, and motor function loss, there are many who are limited in their choices of digital media. While devices themselves may offer accessibility functions, these can be pricey and aren’t always accessible. Therefore, it is highly recommended for sites themselves to provide forms of accessibility to further increase their reach.
