      <h3>Fake News</h3>
      <p>
          Fake news has become something anyone with an online presence has come to fear 
          ever since digital news began to build its mark on our world. Among the thousands 
          of digital news sources out there, there are bound to be authors to misinform a 
          reader to lead them to actions such as scams, identity theft, and fear of fake 
          threats. Fake news can affect anyone, and with artificial intelligence evolving 
          as quickly as it is, it is crucial for people of all demographics, from children 
          to senior citizens, to stay on high alert and to trust the source they are getting 
          their news.Some ways to avoid fake news via the CRAP principles are to keep an eye 
          out for websites that adhere to the principles, and avoid the ones that don’t!

      <h3>Bias Breakdown</h3>
      <p>
          Bias in the news is a dangerous aspect of the news media. Political parties and 
          individual beliefs have changed the face of news sources permanently. Countless 
          news sources lean in certain ways away from the truth to sway readers a certain 
          way towards the bias that the author follows. Bias has been an issue for centuries, 
          before even the news media was present in society. Some ways to avoid bias in the 
          news media you consume are finding a news source that you know produces reports 
          that follow unbiased values.
