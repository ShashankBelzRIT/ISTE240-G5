    <p>Since the time of Jonathan Gutenberg and his movable type printing press around the 1400s, print was the dominant medium for news to be consumed from. The print medium made itself readily accessible for all able to comprehensively read and able enough to pay for such services. With print news, there was a limited number of articles vying for viewers’ attention. Advertising in print news wasn’t as distracting or disruptive for readers, and could more accurately be targeted towards the intended target audience, something especially advantageous for local businesses seeking regular customers. With print being tangible in readers’ hands, many viewed it as being credible; after all, once the news is printed, any mistakes or inaccuracies made would be visible and impossible to directly correct once shipped to customers. This led many print news consumers to assume fact-checking would be held to high standards. Of course, nothing is without its faults, and print media is no exception.</p>
    <p>The fees for the paper, ink, and transportation used in creating and distributing print media limit its audience reach geographically and by audience size. Additionally, updating print news already published would require updated copies to be published, covering more details or correcting mistakes, especially for significant informational inaccuracies or breaking news topics that are still unfolding. This is where pixel news, better known as digital news, brings news into a new era. With billions of people having global access to digital media, digital news outshone print news, in part due to digital media having cheaper costs and a wider reach. Digital news’s nature allows for mistakes or coverage on ongoing breaking news to be quickly and seamlessly updated for the masses. Digital news, unlike print, even allows consumers to feel more connected by directly offering feedback for some digital news providers on their sites, and interaction between consumers in comment sections. While digital news’ prominence led to a significant decline in print news, print news didn’t fall into obscurity or grow complacent. Print news providers began incorporating digital media to offer bonus and exclusive materials for subscribers.
