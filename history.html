    <p>Since the surge in learning and the spread of information from the times of Jonathan Gutenberg and his movable type printing press around the 1400s, print had become an increasingly dominant medium for information to be consumed by the masses. With print, information was readily accessible to all capable of paying for print services, and actually possessing comprehensive reading skills. This made print the perfect method for spreading news across communities filled with a need and desire to be aware of what is occuring locally, nationally, and nationally. With print news, there was a limited number of articles vying for viewers’ attention. Advertising in print news was often formatted in to not be distracting or disruptive for readers when not designated to an advertisement section of pages. Print's approach to presenting advertisements allowed for audiences to be more accurately targeted, which was especially advantageous for local businesses seeking to garner a loyal customer base. With print being tangible in readers’ hands, it was widely viewed as being credible; after all, print news consumers assumed fact-checking would be held to very high standards. Primarily, consumers believed this due to any mistakes or inaccuracies made in print would be visible and impossible to directly or widely correct once actually printed and shipped to customers, especially without spending more resources and losing profits. The desire of being credible and informative while also being profitable served as great motivation for journalists to avoid making critical mistakes or inaccuracies before presenting the news to the public. Of course, nothing is ever truly without its faults, and print media is no exception.</p>

      <h2>Print</h2>
      <p>Print news, while largely accessible and typically formatted with excellence, had various faults that were limiting, could be improved, or simply were failed to be met. Fees for the paper, the ink used in printing machines, and the transportation used in distributing print media were all limits to the geographical reach and size of the target audiences of various news businesses. Additionally, updating print news already published would require updated copies to be published, covering more details or correcting mistakes, especially for significant informational inaccuracies or breaking news topics that are still unfolding. Though, potentially one of the most notable faults of print news was the period of time between events occurring and the actual coverage of events reaching people's hands through print, a period that widened greatly depending on whether events and their coverage were localized or more nationalized, needing to reach audiences over larger distances and time frames. This is where pixel news - better known as digital news - came into the picture, bringing news into a new era for all. Print's faults and the capabilities of the digital world gave room for pixel news' growth in the news media sphere, tackling many of the disadvantages of print news. However, while digital news’ prominence led to a significant decline in print news, print news didn’t fall into obscurity or grow complacent. Print news providers began incorporating digital media to offer bonus and exclusive materials for subscribers.</p>

      <h2>Pixel</h2>
      <p>With billions of people having global access to digital media, digital news outshone print news, in part due to digital media having cheaper costs and a wider reach. Digital news’s nature allows for mistakes or coverage on ongoing breaking news to be quickly and seamlessly updated for the masses. Digital news, unlike print, even allows consumers to feel more connected by directly offering feedback for some digital news providers on their sites, and interaction between consumers in comment sections.</p>
