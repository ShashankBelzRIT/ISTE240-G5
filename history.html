    <p>Since the time of Jonathan Gutenberg and his movable type printing press around the 1400s, print was the dominant medium for news to be consumed from. The print medium made itself readily accessible for all able to comprehensively read and able enough to pay for such services. With print news, there was a limited number of articles vying for viewers’ attention. Advertising in print news wasn’t as distracting or disruptive for readers, and could more accurately be targeted towards the intended target audience, something especially advantageous for local businesses seeking regular customers. With print being tangible in readers’ hands, many viewed it as being credible; after all, once the news is printed, any mistakes or inaccuracies made would be visible and impossible to directly correct once shipped to customers. This led many print news consumers to assume fact-checking would be held to high standards. Of course, nothing is without its faults, and print media is no exception.</p>
