      <h1>History</h1>

      <div class="content">
          <p>Since the time of Jonathan Gutenberg and his movable type printing press around
            the 1400s, print was the dominant medium for news to be consumed from. The print
            medium made itself readily accessible for all able to comprehensively read and
            able enough to pay for such services. With print news, there was a limited number
            of articles vying for viewers’ attention. Advertising in print news wasn’t as
            distracting or disruptive for readers, and could more accurately be targeted
            towards the intended target audience, something especially advantageous for local
            businesses seeking regular customers. With print being tangible in readers’ hands,
            many viewed it as being credible; after all, once the news is printed, any
            mistakes or inaccuracies made would be visible and impossible to directly correct
            once shipped to customers. This led many print news consumers to assume
            fact-checking would be held to high standards. Of course, nothing is without its
            faults, and print media is no exception.</p>
            
          <p>The fees for the paper, ink, and transportation used in creating and distributing
            print media limit its audience reach geographically and by audience size.
            Additionally, updating print news already published would require updated copies
            to be published, covering more details or correcting mistakes, especially for
            significant informational inaccuracies or breaking news topics that are still
            unfolding. This is where pixel news, better known as digital news, brings news
            into a new era. With billions of people having global access to digital media,
            digital news outshone print news, in part due to digital media having cheaper
            costs and a wider reach. Digital news’s nature allows for mistakes or coverage on
            ongoing breaking news to be quickly and seamlessly updated for the masses. Digital
            news, unlike print, even allows consumers to feel more connected by directly
            offering feedback for some digital news providers on their sites, and interaction
            between consumers in comment sections. While digital news’ prominence led to a
            significant decline in print news, print news didn’t fall into obscurity or grow
            complacent. Print news providers began incorporating digital media to offer bonus
            and exclusive materials for subscribers.</p>
