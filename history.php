    <p>
      Since Gutenberg’s printing press in the 1400s, print became the dominant medium for sharing information. 
      News was tangible, widely trusted, and ads were less disruptive, often tailored to local audiences. 
      Because errors were costly to correct once published, journalists were motivated to uphold accuracy and credibility. 
      Print’s strengths made it powerful, but it was not without limits.

    <p>
      Print news was accessible and respected, but costs of paper, ink, and distribution restricted reach. 
      Updating articles required new editions, and coverage often lagged behind events, especially nationally. 
      Breaking news could take days to reach readers, widening the gap between events and awareness. 
      These delays and expenses created space for digital news to grow. 
      As digital media rose, print outlets adapted by offering online content and subscriber exclusives, blending tradition with technology rather than fading into obscurity.

      By the 1990s, the web enabled text and images together, and sites like Nando pioneered digital news. 
      Online platforms quickly surpassed print thanks to lower costs, instant updates, and global reach. 
      Digital news could correct errors or expand coverage in real time, unlike print’s slower cycles. 
      Comment sections further boosted engagement, letting readers connect with journalists and communities worldwide. 
      This interactivity made digital news not only faster and cheaper, but also more participatory, reshaping how audiences consumed and responded to information.
