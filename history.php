    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Since the surge in learning and the spread of information from the times of Jonathan
       Gutenberg and his movable type printing press around the 1400s, print had become an
        increasingly dominant medium for information to be consumed by the masses. With print,
         information was readily accessible to all capable of paying for print services,
          and actually possessing comprehensive reading skills. This made print the perfect
           method for spreading news across communities filled with a need and desire to be
            aware of what is occuring locally, nationally, and nationally. With print news,
             there was a limited number of articles vying for viewers’ attention. Advertising
              in print news was often formatted in to not be distracting or disruptive for
               readers when not designated to an advertisement section of pages. Print's
                approach to presenting advertisements allowed for audiences to be more
                 accurately targeted, which was especially advantageous for local businesses
                  seeking to garner a loyal customer base. With print being tangible in
                   readers’ hands, it was widely viewed as being credible; after all, print
                    news consumers assumed fact-checking would be held to very high standards.
                     Primarily, consumers believed this due to any mistakes or inaccuracies
                      made in print would be visible and impossible to directly or widely
                       correct once actually printed and shipped to customers, especially
                        without spending more resources and losing profits. The desire of
                         being credible and informative while also being profitable served
                          as great motivation for journalists to avoid making critical
                           mistakes or inaccuracies before presenting the news to the public.
                            Of course, nothing is ever truly without its faults, and print media is no exception.</p>

      <p>Print news, while largely accessible and typically formatted with excellence, had various
         faults that were limiting, could be improved, or simply were failed to be met. Fees for the
          paper, the ink used in printing machines, and the transportation used in distributing
           print media were all limits to the geographical reach and size of the target audiences
            of various news businesses. Additionally, updating already published print articles
             would require updated copies to be published, covering more details or correcting
              mistakes, especially for significant informational inaccuracies or breaking news
               topics that are still unfolding. Though, potentially one of the most notable
                faults of print news was the period of time between events occurring and the
                 actual coverage of events reaching people's hands through print, a period that
                  widened greatly depending on whether events and their coverage were localized
                   or more nationalized, needing to reach audiences over larger distances and
                    time frames. This is where pixel news - better known as digital news - came
                     into the picture, bringing news into a new era for all. Print's faults and
                      the capabilities of the digital world gave room for pixel news' growth in
                       the news media sphere, tackling many of the disadvantages of print news.
                        However, while digital news’ prominence led to a significant decline in
                         print news, print news didn’t fall into obscurity or grow complacent.
                          Print news providers began incorporating digital media to offer bonus
                           and exclusive materials for subscribers.</p>

      <p> In the 1900s, as the world wide web advanced enough to have text and images together on
         the same webpage, websites dedicated to the news began to emerge. Nando was the first of
          many to come internet services dedicated to digital news, having been launched in 1993
           by the News & Observer newspaper in North Carolina. With the passing of a few decades
            and billions of people having global access to and actively using the digital world
             of the internet, digital news rapidly came to outshine print news. Digital news'
              rapid growth in only several decades was in part due to digital media having cheaper
               costs and rapidly evolving technology, and largely in part to pixel news'
                significantly wider audience reach. Where print struggled at times to keep up with
                 rapid developments in breaking news, digital news’s nature allowed for mistakes
                  or coverage on ongoing breaking news to be quickly and seamlessly updated for the
                   masses. Another big score in digital news' favor was how online articles could
                    increase retention with consumers through providing comment sections. Consumers
                     had the chance to feel more connected to the journalists and even communities
                      - regardless of distance - by offering direct feedback or critiques on the
                       article's content, and engaging with other commenters on the delivered
                        information or their stances on it, ultimately raising engagement.</p>
