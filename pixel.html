            <h2>AllSides</h2>
            <p>
                AllSides demonstrates a great use of the CRAP principle, allowing for a thorough, friendly user experience. News 
                political ideologies are color-coded to ensure the user can find exactly what they are looking for. Even when purely 
                observing the header, we can see a concise set of tabs and a nav bar that grabs the reader's attention while also not 
                being too detailed to the point that the actual articles seem dull and boring to read.

            <h2>New York Times</h2>
            <p>
                The New York Times follows a more original newspaper format, which many readers flocked to once newspapers began to
                dwindle in relevance. While this page utilizes mainly black and white for its color scheme, the structure of its
                content fulfills the alignment portion of the CRAP principles. The user, while scanning the page, can comprehend
                exactly what they are seeing without the need to take a pause.

                Unlike classic print media, digital media provides much quicker access to specific information the reader desires
                without needing the user to read every single heading or column of information.
