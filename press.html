    <h1>Print Media</h1>
    <p>
        Newspapers have been a large industry that span over 4 centuries. As you would guess, newspapers are made out
        of paper, shocker, I know. Over those 4 centuries, the industry has depleted a large amount of paper and, in
        turn, trees as a result of this industry. In 2006, newspapers generated 5.25 million tons more waste than in
        1960. The manufacturing process itself consumes vast quantities of water and energy and relies on chemicals and
        inks that can pollute air and water sources. Overall, the print media industry places a heavy strain on natural
        resources and ecosystems, making its environmental footprint difficult to ignore.

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Print media’s rise in accessibility began with the introduction of braille newspapers, which allowed the blind to
        read physical newspapers without them being read to them. This raised empowerment amongst the blind community as
        they were allowed more autonomy and independence from a society that declared them dependent.
