        The organization of information is highly important to the way we process it. 
        Our eyes read by rapidly moving across lines of text in a series of quick jumps.
         So as the length of texts increases, our brains skip over more information.
          Following CRAP, however, allows for the best chance at retaining information.
           For example, in teacher training, emphasis on CRAP in visual literacy programs
            has been shown to significantly increase teachers’ ability to create educational 
            materials that are both more engaging and clearer for students, improving comprehension and retention.

                Studies show that using the CRAP principles in information designs allow 
                readers to comprehend and process the information better!

        A website should not be a book; the information must be formatted in a way to 
        entice the reader. Having paragraph upon paragraph just bores the reader and 
        hinders the effectiveness of your website. Statistics show that the easier a 
        group of text is on the eyes based on text size, colors, and other factors, 
        the better a reader’s comprehension of the text. There are sources all over 
        the internet that are on a large spectrum of following these tactics horribly or very well.
